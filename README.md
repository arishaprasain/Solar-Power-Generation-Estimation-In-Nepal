 **Introduction:**

 
Nepal, endowed with abundant water resources, has primarily relied on major hydropower sources for electricity generation. However, it's worth noting that the country possesses an untapped and substantial solar energy potential, estimated to be 100 times greater than its water resources. Recognizing this vast potential, our project aims to revolutionize the energy landscape by harnessing solar power using machine learning to predict the total power that can be generated in each district.




**Current Energy Scenario:**
Historically, Nepal has been a pioneer in harnessing hydropower for electricity generation, with significant contributions from major rivers and their tributaries. While hydropower has played a crucial role, the country has yet to fully explore the immense solar energy potential that can complement and diversify the energy mix.





**Solar Power Potential:**
Solar power, with its 100 times greater potential compared to water resources, presents a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative. Nepal's geographical location, with ample sunlight throughout the year, makes it conducive for large-scale solar energy projects. By tapping into this potential, we can significantly reduce reliance on hydropower and enhance energy security. There are more than 2800 good sites for solar power plant establishment in Nepal but from the total power generated in Nepal, only 0.1 % of the power is that of solar.

**Our Project: Predictive Power Generation Modeling**
Our project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the total power that can be generated from solar sources in each district. The predictive model takes into account various factors, including geographical features, weather patterns, and historical solar irradiance data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide accurate and dynamic forecasts for solar power generation potential.





**Key Features of the ML Model:**

Geospatial Analysis: The model incorporates geospatial data to understand the topography and sunlight exposure of each district.
Historical Data: The model learns from historical solar irradiance data to improve accuracy and adapt to seasonal variations.

Web App Interface:
We are developing a user-friendly web app. The app allows users to explore district-wise predictions, understand the factors influencing solar power generation.







**Benefits of the Project:**

Diversification of Energy Sources: Our project promotes a diversified energy portfolio by unlocking the vast potential of solar power.
Increased Energy Security: By reducing dependence on a single energy source, Nepal can enhance its energy security and resilience.
Environmental Sustainability: Solar power is a clean and renewable energy source, contributing to the country's commitment to environmental sustainability.
